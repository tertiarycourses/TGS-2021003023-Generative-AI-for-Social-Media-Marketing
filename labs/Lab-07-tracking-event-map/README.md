# Lab 07: Tracking event map → Frequency and fatigue

TGS-2021003023 • v1.1 • Synthetic teaching scenario

## Scenario
Harbour & Grove is a fictional Singapore home-goods SME launching a reusable desk organiser. The retail price is S$39; estimated contribution margin is S$14 per order. No real customer or platform data is included.

## Deliverables
- event and UTM schema; decision: Validate event firing with test conversion.
- KPI dashboard model; decision: Judge campaign on objective metric.
- creative efficiency report; decision: Refresh hook when CTR falls with stable reach.
- unit economics table; decision: Compare with margin-adjusted break-even.
- fatigue alert; decision: Rotate creative when frequency rises and CTR falls.

## Detailed procedure
1. Create a UTM naming convention and map ad click, landing view, lead submit and qualified lead.
2. Using mock-data.csv, calculate CTR = clicks/impressions and CPC = spend/clicks; state units.
3. Calculate CPA = spend/qualified leads and ROAS = attributed revenue/spend; compare with margin.
4. Calculate frequency = impressions/reach; compare rising frequency with declining CTR to diagnose fatigue.
5. Check consent before any pixel/event plan; validate a synthetic test conversion and avoid real customer data.
6. Save the event map, formula sheet and a data-quality note.

## Acceptance checks
- No real personal information or unlicensed customer content.
- A named source for every factual claim.
- One explicit reviewer decision per output.
- The mock campaign remains unpublished.
